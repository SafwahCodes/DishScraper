# DishScraper
Small library to scrape recipes from specific websites (for personal use)

I created this library to solve my need of collecting recipes from the internet. I have toyed with this concept for a while now and thought this would be a useful library to share with others.

An example of how to use the library can be found in example.py.

## Websites that can be used with this tool

- BudgetBytes (www.budgetbytes.com)
- Jamie Oliver (www.jamieoliver.com) - takes into account the new and old style recipe format
